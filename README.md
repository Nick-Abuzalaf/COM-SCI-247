# Comparing Dictionaries and Word Embeddings

This is the repository for the SemEval 2022 Shared Task #1: Comparing
Dictionaries and Word Embeddings (CODWOE).

This repository currently contains: the configuration for the codalab
competition, a Docker image to reproduce the environment, a scorer, a
format-checker and baseline programs to help participants get started.

Will be added to this repository at a later date: data or link to the data for
the competition, code for training our models, and results.
